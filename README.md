This repository is a playground showcasing `Jetpack Compose`.
I took this opportunity to explore and experiment with Jetpack toolkit features.

The idea behind the app is similar to a piggy bank. 
Keeping records of rewards in exchange for positive actions.
The accumulated amount can be withdrawn later and spent on something like a hobby :)
